            "The history of the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) is a fascinating journey that began in 1901 with the establishment of the Manila Trade School (MTS). Initially focused on imparting practical skills to Filipino adults in trades like carpentry, telegraphy, and machine shop work, MTS later evolved into the Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) in 1910, offering intermediate grade courses. By 1959, PSAT was renamed the Philippine College of Arts and Trades (PCAT), pioneering graduate degree programs in industrial education. Finally, in 1978, PCAT was elevated to TUP status by virtue of President Decree No. 1518. Since then, TUP has continued to lead in providing higher vocational and technical education, contributing significantly to the country's industrial and technological landscape.\n 2. The rich history of the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) spans over a century, tracing its roots back to the Manila Trade School (MTS) established in 1901. From its humble beginnings, MTS evolved into the Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) in 1910, offering a wider array of courses and pioneering industrial education in the Philippines. This transformation continued with the renaming of PSAT to the Philippine College of Arts and Trades (PCAT) in 1959, which subsequently became TUP in 1978. Throughout its history, TUP has been at the forefront of providing advanced vocational, technical, and professional education, shaping generations of skilled professionals and contributing significantly to the nation's development.\n For more detailed information, you can visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tup.edu.ph/page/about\"> here</a>\n"

			"By virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1518, the Philippine College of Arts and Trades (PCAT) was converted into the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP) on June 11, 1976. The conversion to a university status brought about comprehensive changes in the organizational set-up. To carry out its tasks, the University had to change its one-college structure to a system composed of six colleges, one of which is the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). The CAS was created in 1979 with its four departments, namely: the Languages, the Social and Behavioral Sciences, the Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and the Physical Education. In 1991, the College was mandated to perform dual roles: as a service college and as a science college. On July 24, 1995, the TUP Board of Regents through Referendum No. 13, s. 1995 approved the devolution of some Master Programs of the Graduate School to the mother colleges. Since then, the granting of the degrees in the Master of Arts in Teaching with specializations in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and General Science has become the responsibility of the College of Arts and Sciences. On September 15, 1995, the University Board of Regents authorized to split the College of Arts and Sciences into the College of Science and the College of Liberal Arts. The new College of Science was structured to include graduate programs in Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and General Science. The college also offers five (5) baccalaureate programs, namely: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Bachelor of Science in Information Systems, Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and Bachelor of Applied Science Major in Laboratory Technology."
